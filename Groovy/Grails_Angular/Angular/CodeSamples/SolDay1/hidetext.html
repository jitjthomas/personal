	Here, itâ€™s ng-show and ng-hide that do our work. They provide equivalent but inverse
	functionality for showing and hiding based on the expression you pass to them. That
	is, ng-show will show its element when its expression is true and hide it when false. The
	ng-hide hides when true and shows when false. You should use whichever makes more
	sense to express your intention.These directives work by setting the element styles to display:block to
	show and display:none to hide as appropriate.
